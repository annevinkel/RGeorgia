#### Exercises
Begin this practical by setting the maximum line length in `R-Studio` to 80 characters. Go to `RStudio`'s `Preferences` (or `Global Options` under `Tools`) --> `Code` --> `Display`, and tick the `show margin` box. Make sure that the `margin column` is set to `80`

This is also a good time to set Rstudio to not automatically restore .RData into workspace at startup and not to save workspace to .RData on exit. (`Tools` --> `Global Options` --> `General`)

---

1. **Load package `mice`. **

---

2. **Most packages have datasets included. Open the `mammalsleep` dataset from package `mice` by typing `mammalsleep` in the console, and subsequently by using the function `View()`. **

---

3. **Write the mammalsleep dataset from package `mice` to the work directory as a tab-delimited text file with `.` as a decimal seperator. Name the file `mammalsleep.txt`**

---

4. **Import the `mammalsleep.txt` file. **

---

5. **The dataset we've just imported contains the sleepdata by Allison & Cicchetti (1976). Inspect the sleepdata and make yourself familiar with it. **

---

6. **Save the current workspace. Name the workspace `Practical_B.RData`. Also, save the sleepdata file as a separate workspace called `Sleepdata.RData`. **


---

7. **Some animals were not used in the calculations by Allison and Cicchetti. Exclude the following animals from the sleepdata dataset: Echidna, Lesser short-tailed shrew and Musk shrew. Save the dataset as sleepdata2.** Tip: use the square brackets to indicate [rows, columns].

---

8. **Let's try reading in some data with special characters. On the course homepage, you will find the file `cabinet.txt`. Try reading this into R, and try getting the special characters right**
If you're going to work with special characters in your code files (say, writing comments in Danish) you will want to set the RStudio encoding to UTF-8 as welll, under `Tools` --> `Global Options` --> `Code` --> `Saving`
